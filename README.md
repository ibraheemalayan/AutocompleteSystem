# LSTM Trie AutoComplete System

## Overview

Welcome to the LSTM Trie AutoComplete System repository! This project demonstrates an advanced autocomplete system that leverages the capabilities of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks and trie data structures. The project is designed as a Flask web application that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the autocomplete functionality.

## Usage

Once the Flask application is running, you can access the web interface in your web browser. The interface allows you to input text and receive autocomplete suggestions powered by the LSTM model and trie structure.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions from the community. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements.
